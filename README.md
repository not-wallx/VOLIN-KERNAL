**Volin-Kernel** is a custom 32-bit kernel written in Assembly, designed for learning, experimentation, and building lightweight operating systems from scratch. This kernel focuses on simplicity, stability, and performance while providing a foundation for advanced OS development.



## Features

- 32-bit protected mode support
- Low-level hardware control using Assembly
- Minimalistic design for learning and experimentation
- Bootable via GRUB or other bootloaders
- Easily extensible for custom drivers and OS features



## Requirements

- NASM (Netwide Assembler)  
- QEMU (or another emulator) for testing  
- GRUB (for bootloader support)  
- Linux or Windows environment for compiling and running
